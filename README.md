# Xio pay

Xio pay is a tool for creating and managing on-chain donations.
With Xio pay whether you are Web3 native or not, you can easily create donation campaigns and manage is Web2 like view.
Once you create donation campaign, you can plug-in donation widget to any website you'd like to add!

## Motivation

The traditional way of online payment is always tricky. When do you truly own the asset that you are paid? The moment transaction is happened? What if the app is shut down for some reason? What if the middle protocol hold your asset for any reason?

Owning asset never been this simpler concept without Web3. We implement this with Quick & Cheap layer 1 NeoX. 

On top of this simply, Smart contract is stand-alone server that will never go down. User have freedom to use different app or even create their own app for themselves to manage their donation campaigns.
